Globally, improving remotely sensed characterization of biophysical properties of vegetation is of paramount importance for a variety of applications. Changes of Plant Leaf Area and Its Relationships with Soil Factors in the Process of Grassland Desertification.In particular, the non-destructive estimation of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) from earth observation data has been topical for decades. LAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area.This script represents the leaf area index using the Sentinel 2 satellite. There are examples of this equation, but this equation uses the value of several different bands to calculate the leaf index value in a simple way.
Leaf area index is one of the most important parameters in determining plant yields. On the other hand, agricultural scientists calculate this index using special hardware. But because of the global reach of the index in this method, the basis of validation is the data of MODIS product : MCD15A3H(500 M, 4 DAY).
The present script is the result of combining and simplifying the previous methods.
But the initial idea of ​​the script was based on the following basic method:
